# Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard

Developed during my Data & Digital internship at Protiviti, this project features an interactive sales performance dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI Desktop. The dashboard analyzes the publicly available Superstore dataset from Kaggle, applying professional-grade data cleaning, modeling, and visualization techniques to simulate a real-world business scenario.

## Project Overview

The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into Superstore's sales data, including key performance metrics such as total sales, profit margins, product category performance, and shipping efficiency. Designed with multiple interactive elements like slicers and filters, it enables dynamic exploration and supports data-driven decision-making.
